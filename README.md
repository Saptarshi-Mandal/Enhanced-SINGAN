Please refer the project's [page](https://github.com/kligvasser/SinGAN) for the unofficial implementation.

## Introduction
The project implements the **Enhanced SinGAN** model, a robust and versatile version of the original SinGAN model [(Shaham et al., ICCV, 2019)](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/papers/Shaham_SinGAN_Learning_a_Generative_Model_From_a_Single_Natural_Image_ICCV_2019_paper.pdf). The Enhanced SinGAN is designed to be less sensitive to input image quality, enabling it to generate clean images even from noisy inputs.

## Features
1. **Enhance Robustness:** Improve SinGANâ€™s ability to handle varying image quality by developing a model that generates high-quality outputs even from noisy input images. This is achieved through the following  approaches:
    - **Introduction of Losses:**
        - **Total Variational Loss:** This loss penalizes differences between neighboring pixels both horizontally and vertically. It is a measure of the variation in an image, focusing on preserving sharp edges  while smoothing out flat areas and reducing noise.
    - **Image Preprocessing:** Denoise and sharpen the noisy input image before feeding it to the SinGAN network.
        - **Classical Denoising Techniques:** Non Local Means, Bilateral Filtering
        - **Classical Sharpening Techniques:** High Boost Filtering, Adaptive Histogram Equalization

## Results
The following are sample images geenrated by the Enhances SinGAN model:

## Comparison and Analysis
Analysis of the above modifications on the quality of the generated images shows that the Enhanced SinGAN is more robust to noisy input images.
