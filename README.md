Please refer the project's [page](https://github.com/kligvasser/SinGAN) for the unofficial implementation.

## Introduction
The project implements the **Enhanced SinGAN** model, a robust and versatile version of the original SinGAN model [(Shaham et al., ICCV, 2019)](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/papers/Shaham_SinGAN_Learning_a_Generative_Model_From_a_Single_Natural_Image_ICCV_2019_paper.pdf). The Enhanced SinGAN is designed to be less sensitive to input image quality, enabling it to generate clean images even from noisy inputs.

## Features
1. **Enhance Robustness:** Improve SinGAN’s ability to handle varying image quality by developing a model that generates high-quality outputs even from noisy input images. This is achieved through the following  approaches:
    - **Introduction of Losses:**
        - **Total Variational Loss:** This loss penalizes differences between neighboring pixels both horizontally and vertically. It is a measure of the variation in an image, focusing on preserving sharp edges while smoothing out flat areas and reducing noise.
            - *Constant TV weights*
            - *Scale dependent TV weights:* At coarser scales, noise tends to be less pronounced, and the focus is primarily on capturing global structures. For finer scales, more meticulous denoising efforts are required to preserve intricate details and textures. So, the TV weight is adjusted to be higher for finer scales and lower for coarser scales.
    - **Image Preprocessing:** Denoise and sharpen the noisy input image before feeding it to the SinGAN network.
        - **Classical Denoising Techniques:** Non Local Means, Bilateral Filtering
        - **Classical Sharpening Techniques:** High Boost Filtering, Adaptive Histogram Equalization

## Results
The following are sample images generated by the Enhanced SinGAN model for different sigma and constant TV weights:

## Comparison and Analysis
Analysis of the above modifications on the quality of the generated images shows that the Enhanced SinGAN is more robust to noisy input images.

The following graph shows that the BRISQUE scores of the images generated by the SinGAN are much higher (bad quality) compared to those generated by the Enhanced SinGAN (better quality).
